The project involves creating a real-time Chat Web Application using PHP, 
MySQL, JavaScript, and AJAX. It enables users to sign up, log in, and interact 
with others through a secure, interactive messaging interface. The system 
includes user management (sign-up, login, logout), real-time message exchanges, 
and a dynamic user interface that updates instantly as users send or receive 
messages.
